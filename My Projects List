Credit Card Clients in Taiwan 2005:
Based on the financial capability of a client, they get a credit limit, i.e., the maximum amount they can spend in a month through a credit card.The credit card companies maintain comprehensive data about each of their clients. 
By analyzing the data, they can know what would be the maximum amount they won't be able to recover from their clients yet able to make a significant profit in a financial year to run a sustainable business.
